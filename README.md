# NazReid-Contract

This project uses K Means Clustering to predict Naz Reid's next contract. 

The full article is avaliable via my Medium account (@KyleGalsky).

The Naz-Contract.R file contains all the R code used to create this project. The NBAData.csv and ContractData.cvs are the datasets that I created to use for this project. Both can be used to replicate this project in R. The two .jpg files are the two histogram outputs I created in R for the Medium article.
